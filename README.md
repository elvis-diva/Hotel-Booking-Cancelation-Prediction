Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction
📌 Overview
This project predicts hotel booking cancellations using machine learning. By analyzing historical booking data, we aim to identify key factors that influence cancellations and help hotels make data-driven decisions to reduce revenue loss.

📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is hotel_bookings.csv, which contains information about reservations, including:

Customer details (e.g., adults, children, country)

Booking information (e.g., lead time, deposit type, previous cancellations)

Stay details (e.g., number of nights, room type)

Outcome (whether the booking was canceled or not)

🛠 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy (Data Preprocessing)

Seaborn, Matplotlib (Data Visualization)

Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)

🔍 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
Handled missing values by filling them with median/mode or dropping columns.

Converted categorical features into numerical representations using one-hot encoding.

Selected key features such as lead_time, stays_in_weekend_nights, deposit_type, etc.

📊 Model & Performance
Model Used: Logistic Regression

Accuracy Achieved: 81%

Next Steps:

Improve feature selection

Try different models (Random Forest, XGBoost)

Address class imbalance if necessary

🚀 How to Run the Project
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Run the script in PyCharm or a Jupyter Notebook:

python
Copy
Edit
python hotel_booking_prediction.py
📌 Future Improvements
Implement Random Forest/XGBoost for better performance.

Explore feature importance to understand cancellation drivers.

Use SMOTE or other techniques if data is imbalanced.
